   My Project ia about a marathon 2020 T-shirt order. The employees in different departments in the company are required to register and fill in their departments names, T-shirt size and colours to order.  
   The application is live here [https://order-proje.herokuapp.com/](https://order-proje.herokuapp.com/).
   ## UX
   This project is for all the employees in the company who would like to participate in the marathon.

   1. Git add "file name".
   2. Git commit -m "commit message"
   3. git push 
   - It was later pushed to Heroku where it was an automatic deployment because I had connected direct to GitHub;
   - In the heroku dashboard for the application, I clicked on "deploy" > "GitHub" 
   - Then I clicked on Enable Automatic Deployment button.
   - In the heroku dashboard for the application, I clicked on "Settings" > "Reveal Config Vars" and set the config vars.
   - In the heroku dashboard for the application, I clicked on "deploy" > "Deploy Branch" Then "View"
